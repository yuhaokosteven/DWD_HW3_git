  <h2>Fluto</h2>
  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p>Fluto s a colossal electronic wind instrument. With Fluto, you can conduct a visual symphony with friends blowing into your phone. Our idea was to create an interactive installation piece that would engage people of all different nationalities
    and ages prompt them to enjoy the experience together with others.
    â€‹
    Fluto is created in Fall 2018 by the team of Yuhao Ko, Meicheng Jia, Rebecca Shurnik, and Caleb Ferguson for our interactive Pop-up Windows Display at ITP.</p>

  <h2>Under the City</h2>
  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p>Under the City is an augmented reality applications that connects real world and virtual world. Imaging there is a crazy minion world underground! In this world, minions are crazy playing around with their world. After we went to the Time
    Square in New York City and looked around the buildings to see what we can do with them, we came up a great idea of destroy the floor, buildings and screens by making holes on them. Once the hole came up user will see an other totally different
    world in the other side of the hole. We want to include the gesture detection in the ARKit, and let users to use gesture to create the hole that connects to another world. The hole will be a portal of the reality and fantasy world, and we will
    make a series of fantasy world for people to play with.</p>
